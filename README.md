Multi-frame dicom files
=======================

Hey guys, in my workplace I had a task to make a multi-frame dicom files and to view them, so I come up with a solution, hope you will enjoy my solution.
I have used existing libraries in my project.
I didn't have any chance to clean up my code, there are still some commented and unnecessary codes, sorry for that, you can use the parts you need.

Here's the screen-recording of the app:
